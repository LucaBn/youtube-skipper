# YouTubeSkipper

`YouTubeSkipper` is a Chrome extension that allows users to automatically skip videos from specific artists or songs on YouTube. If you're watching a playlist and the next queued video is by an artist or a song you'd rather avoid, `YouTubeSkipper` steps in automatically, skipping to the next video.

It can be obviously used for any kind of content, not only music.

## Features

- **Customization:** Users can specify a list of artists or song titles to skip directly from the extension's interface.
- **Ease of Use:** Once set up, the extension operates in the background, enhancing your YouTube listening experience without manual interruptions.
- **Flexibility:** Suitable for a wide range of musical preferences and podcasts.
